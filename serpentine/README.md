# How to get the flag

So, there's a code error when you choose to print the flag, however though you can call the **print_flag()** function to if-else statement.

my if-else statement for **choice b** would be like this

```
  elif choice == 'b':
      # print('\nOops! I must have misplaced the print_flag function! Check my source code!\n\n')
      print_flag()

```

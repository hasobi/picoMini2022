# How to get the flag

## 1. paste this to your terminal
```
nc saturn.picoctf.net 53639
```
## 2. Take a look at the encrypted flag which 0x31 bla bla bla
```
It is hexadecimal and you need to convert it to string
```

## My flag is below but yours might be different.
```FLAG
picoCTF{gl17ch_m3_n07_811fffee}
```

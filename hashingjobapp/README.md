# How to produce flag

## 1. Paste the nc saturn.picoctf.net 51108 to the terminal
```
nc saturn.picoctf.net 51108
```

## 2. You'll have to solve or convert the text to MD5 several times

I was failed or confused in this challenge to be exact because i thought that i only need to convert text to md5 once, 
turns out it was several times (mine was 3 times) and then you'll have your flag.
